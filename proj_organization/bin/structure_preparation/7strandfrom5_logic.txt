#Both VMD and chimera can be used for creating 7 stranded system, however i used chimera in the following steps
The merge selection from VMD, after translting coordinates was giving a error while mutating gly to ala
The glycing residues were modelled in a way that chimera was giving the error, unable to find backbone of some glycine atoms

Somehow, VMD 1.9.3 was unable to keep sidechain atoms (specifically Hydrogen from PSF) during merge command (merging two or more structures from different instances) 
why this really was the case is unknown to me

So, I took the zoriented pdb structure of 2SLK without ACE and other nonstandard residues at the termini.
1. Take zori_prot.pdb
2. select first left hand side of second three last strands, withre BGL or NDI starnds, turn on 'Movement Mouse mode' from structure editing under tools.
 switch to Move selection module instead of default Normal and thereafter, press the wheel and turn move the strands to outermost side by approproate guess,
3. repeat on other side, and save the new cooridnates only, that are translated.
4. open zori_prot and newly translated strands (extra2ladjacent_ayers_random_mousemovemnt_chimera.pdb) together
5. Combine both the models together using 'combine #0,1'
6. Save the coordinates of newly given model#02 (7strands_chimera_without_hydorgenbond.pdb)
7. Align structure to Z direction using la orient script (7strands_chimera_without_hydorgenbond_zoriented.pdb)
8. Translate the strands in the vmd 
first select the strands (3, one from each layer, outermost) #by default end strands will be BGL or NDI copies/
set sel [atomselect top "all and chain 'P' or 'Q' or 'S'"] #or and, forgot
$sel moveby {0 0 +-0.1}
till h bonds are maximized
#VMD translation was only used to maximize the H bonds (rest structre was prepared in chimera)
9. save new cooridnates and then save them  (7starnd_vmd_hydrogen.pdb)
10. Minimize the structure using 10000 default steps (chimera), (7strands_chimera_without_hydorgenbond.pdb)
All this is compiled in vmd chimera, 7StrandLogicDefaultFiles.zip
11. now swap the aa together (swapaa ala ::gly) #for all chains
12. new minimized file is 2slkMod7strand.pdb
