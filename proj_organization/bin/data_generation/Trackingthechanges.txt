Tracking the changes being made:


will keep updating the readme, 

deletethe stuff for the 3 layer,
#(done, for layer 1, for layer3, unnecessary stuff deleted)

organize the content of the main calls and their equilibrium and non equilibrium counterparts
#yet to be done, and not very important


certain files are supposed to be present in all cases
(taken care of)

#modify the template design and add basic project layout to shashi's master project bash script.
(pending)

get framestravelled highlighte din the main program only,

need to know the  regions where peaks are supposed to be found out

Get the description of each function in detail, 
and the data output, where that function is being called and its expected output

tuple(key_hbatom)
should i change it from hbhasKeyAndFramewiseValue
(done the change)

satisfied with the context of the program (especially of H bond calclutaions)
(it could have been simpler, buut its not)

Project name
Project description
Bunch of files

'Dress for the job you want, not the job you have.'


Thinking not to move into object oriented stuff, but deisgn can be thought off and implemented

#generated figure3, F vs D, [use it to proxy the call3layer.py and imporve the overall design]
use differnt hash for fast and slow,



Do the analysis as per  the rings and cooperativity
do as following, 


three rings each side, 
including both the chains, make 3 super rings, where eachj will account for the two terminus regions and regions near to termini and the middle region,
for to call the integrity of the ring, do the follwoing,
    If one H bond from either of the ring is present, 

create 6 small rings, 
    either one or both of H bonds are supposed to be present in that case [2 different ways]

for each such scenario, 
3 plots.
plot them with the frame data, for clarity purpose do them in bins of 10 frames, if Hb ring is poresnt in atleast 50% of those rames mark it as presnt else absent, 
start it from frame 1, show in background the force data

Figure 1: Overview of beta-sheet nanocrystal shape, hydrogen bonding pattern and SMD
boundary conditions. A) Representative poly-ALA model showing geometrical parameters
used to define nanocrystal unit structure. The h, L,and b parameters corresponds in the
nanocrystal to number of residues in a beta-strand, the number of beta-strands in a sheet, and
number of sheets respectively. B) Figure showing hydrogen bonds topology in an ideal
antiparallel beta-stand arrangement. It also shows ‘hydrogen bond ring’ (HB), which involves
10 intermittent atoms between donor and acceptor and similarly, ‘non-hydrogen bond ring’
(NHB) has 14 atoms. C) Cartoon representation showing the boundary condition of middle
sheet used in SMD along with showing the central beta-strand (beta-CS). Hydrogen bonds are
shown as thin lines between strands.

Figure 2: Sidechain packing in beta-sheet nanocrystal. The transversal cross-section of
nanocrystal showing Face-to-Face sidechain packing arrangement of a beta-strand in the
middle sheet observed in various poly-amino acid models. The central beta-strand (beta-CS)
packing is shown for SAA, PAA, and HAA models after equilibration step. A) The beta-CS
is shown in blue color and other strands are shown either in yellow or red colors. The
backbone and sidechain are shown in licorice and sphere representations, respectively.

Figure 3: Representative average Force-displacement profile of pulling beta-CS in various
poly-amino acid nanocrystals. Here, the best fit line is obtained as average of displacement at
bin width of 0.1 Å.
Figure 4: Mean tensile strength and toughness of various poly-amino acid models. A)
Histogram of mean rupture peak force from three replicates is shown for SAA, PAA and
HAA nanocrystals.B) Mean toughness calculated as area under the curve averaged force-
displacement curves from three replicates are shown for SAA, PAA and HAA models. The
standard deviation is shown as error bars on histogram.
Figure 5: Hydrogen bond distribution at the maximum peak force. The figure is showing
mean count of all hydrogen bonds, adjacent h-bonds and inter-sheet h-bonds in figure A, B
and C respectively. The subtypes of hydrogen bond as MCMC, MCSC and SCSC are shown
in gray, teal and orange red colors on histogram respectively. The standard deviation of three
replicates is shown as error bars on respective stacked region of histogram.

Figure S1: RMSD of all considered homopolymers models has been shown from NPT
equilibration and calculated from minimized structure. Based on stabilization of all systems
(~1ns), SMD pulling has been initiated from that time point. Only strands those were not
fixed were used for calculating RMSD and ~4 ns of parallel production phase (after ~1ns of
equilibration) has shown that systems remain largely stabilized in parallel nonbiased
conditions. Increase in RMSD for bigger systems especially for HAA has been observed as
they undergo twist from minimized structure.

Figure S2: Overall orientation of nanocrystals prior to pulling has been shown for all
considered homopolymers. Same timepoint snapshot that was used for inferring FToF
contacts (Figure 2) has been used. Flat and twisted orientation can be easily inferred for
bigger groups on contrasting with SAA.
Figure S3: Force profiles with displacement of strand as function of pulling velocity has been
shown for all the replicates, light gray colored has been used for representation of raw data
and black line on top showed the displacement wise averaging.

###tasks, 4 dec 2020
Do the following:

Sno. priority Effort(hrs)    taskName
1.	high	4	Make figure specific programs ready [almost done other than TCL files]
2.	Med	2	Transfer the data to main repository for left out 4 polymers
    Moving tyroneP's mentonsetpolythreonine to menton set polythreonine
    
3. High 2   Crop the DCD to point where it just came out, record the final framecount
3.	Medium	6	Run and code maintenance for file and write unknown objectives
4.	High	2	Write the readme
5.	Medium	12	Compare and contrast the data for the two modes

Figure raw data generation and rest of the stuff is pending so far,  

Crop all the simulations to the point where they were out of the system, dont include rest.


STuck for getting documentation of the fraction analysis done by me (done), i have to be sure that H bonds were changed in starting of the calculations

fraction are dcumented and now is the case for vsdisp counts and hetamap tiles,
